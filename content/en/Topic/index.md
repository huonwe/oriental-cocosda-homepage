Cocosda supports the development of new topic domains. A new topic domain is warranted by a new speech technology application ONLY if that application places new demands on the form of data corpora, or the approaches for technology evaluation, required to support the new technology application. In disassociating the specific application of a corpus or set of corpora from its/their design characteristics, Cocosda is open to topic domains that relate to the formal documentation of spoken language without reference to any specific technological application. If redundancy is seen between a new topic domain proposal and that of an existing topic domain, then a combined topic domain will be considered.
